# Homework 2
Working With GettyImages API and Twitter API

## Heroku Implemented
+ Heroku is now implemented

### Understanding/Mastering the Program:

#### What was the theme you chose?
+ I chose space along with the tweets that would corresspond with the dark sci-fi anthology show, Black Mirror.

#### How did you pick your searches to fit your theme?
+ I picked up a space/dark theme that would match the content of the tweets.

#### What are known problems, if any on your project?
+ I do not believe I have any problems with my project, but I did have problems with getting my bearer token, which I believe was because of the rate limit.

#### How would you improve if you had more time?
+ Add more precise fields and parameters in the twitter/gettyimages to really narrow down the subject and add some CSS rules to style the webpage more.
